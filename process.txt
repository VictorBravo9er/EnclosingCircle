0 START
1 start with two points, initialize  circle passing through them(set centre as
  midpoint of the points), initialize a diameter
2 read in next point, if none left goto step 5
3 if point is on/inside the circle, repeat step 2, else goto step 4
4 update the centre of the circle to a point along the diameter(infinite line)
  such that the new point and the diametric point farthest from the point are
  equidistant to this new centre. Update the new diameter
5 STOP
