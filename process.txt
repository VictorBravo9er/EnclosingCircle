1 start with two points, initialize  circle passing through them(set centre as
  midpoint of the points), Select these points such that every other point are
  to one side of these points. O(n)
  Also initialize any related values related to the perpendicular bisector of
  these points, namely m and c. O(1)
  We will be drawing the circle passing throught these points, whatsoever.
2 read in all points, if none left goto step 5 O(n)
3 if point is on/inside the circle, repeat step 2, else goto step 4
4 Update the centre of the circle to a point along the perpendicular bisector of
  the initial two points, in such a way that the new point is also equidistant 
  to this new centre. O(1)
